# ToDo-List (Vanilla JS)

A "todo list" web app built using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS.
A user can make a list of tasks, can mark it completed and delete the tasks. 
This is hosted on Netlify. 

### Future changes:

Currently there is no state management library used to manage the state, the DOM is changed according to the action i.e adding or removing tasks. **Redux** will be included in the next version to manage state.
